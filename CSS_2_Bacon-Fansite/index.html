    You can only have a single instance of one particular id name inside a single page. 
    You would use the id to identify elements where there is only a single one of them on a particular page.
    There is probably one heading.
    You can use class to group related elements that are all going to behave or have a similar style.
    Any HTML element can have more than one class but it can only have one id.
